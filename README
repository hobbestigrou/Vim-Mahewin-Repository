Vim-Mahewin-Repository

A vim setup with cool plugin and colorscheme. Feel free to use and contrib. Inspired by oh-my-zsh.

Included plugins:
* Ack.vim
* Command-t.vim
* fugitive.vim
* NERD_commenter.vim
* Tabular.vim

Ack.vim:
:Ack followed by text you wish ack for. It's fairly obvious to navigate the results. Note that you will need ack installed.

NERD_commenter.vim:
Easy commenting for many filetypes.
<leader>cc comment out the current line or text selected in visual mode.
<leader>cn same as <leader>cc but force nesting.
