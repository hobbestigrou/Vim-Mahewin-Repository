VimRepository

A vim setup with cool plugin and colorscheme. Feel free to use and contrib. Inspired by oh-my-zsh.

Included plugins:
* Ack.vim
* fugitive.vim
* commandt.vim

Ack.vim:
:Ack followed by text you wish ack for. It's fairly obvious to navigate the results. Note that you will need ack installed.
