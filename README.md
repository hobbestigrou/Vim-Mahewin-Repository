### Vim-Mahewin-Repository

A vim setup with cool plugin and colorscheme. Feel free to use and contrib. Inspired by oh-my-zsh.

Included plugins:

* Ack.vim
* ctrlp.vim
* fugitive.vim
* NERD_commenter.vim
* Tabular.vim

### Install

To install the project simply clone:

    git clone https://github.com/hobbestigrou/Vim-Mahewin-Repository.git .vim-mahewin-repository

And then make a symbolic link:

    ln -s .vim-mahewin-repository/vimrc .vimrc

### Ack.vim:
:Ack followed by text you wish ack for. It's fairly obvious to navigate the results. Note that you will need ack installed.

### NERD_commenter.vim:
Easy commenting for many filetypes.
<leader>cc comment out the current line or text selected in visual mode.
<leader>cn same as <leader>cc but force nesting.
