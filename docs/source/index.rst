Introduction
============
Vim-Mahewin-Repository is a Vim distribution like janus or bling, or prezto for
zsh.

What does that mean
===================
It's my personal vim distribution that I have tweaked over time and evolved
from a simple vanilla vimrc configuration to a full-blown distribution that it
is today.

That included few good plugin, map, alias and so on.
